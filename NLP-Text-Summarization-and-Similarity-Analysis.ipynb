多數經濟學家及國際財經機構認為，中國在二零一二年的國內生產總值（gross domestic product，簡稱 gdp）增速將回落，但仍會以相對較高的速度增長。因此，在中短期內，中國鋼鐵生產有一定的擴張潛 力，對鐵礦產品的需求較為強勁。從供應方面看，世界三大鐵礦商近幾年來一直堅持推進擴張戰略，但由於 物流運輸條件、金融環境及其他限制擴產的瓶頸依然沒有得到解決，全球鐵礦產品短期內供應大幅增加的 幾率很小，即使供應增加，本公司的成本優勢也完全有能力與國際鐵礦供應商競爭。總體來看，鐵礦產品供 需關係在近期內將維持一個「準平衡」的狀態，所以鐵礦石價格在二零一二年仍然會在較高位上運行。 然而，我們也清醒的認識到，全球金融危機呈蔓延的趨勢，特別是歐洲的主權債務危機形勢極為嚴峻，短期 內很難得到有效化解；在前次金融危機後，一些主要經濟體恢復緩慢、活力不足、增長乏力；世界某些地緣 政治熱點問題較為突出，隱藏著諸多不穩定因素。所有這些都會直接或間接影響鐵礦市場，造成鐵礦產品價 格的短期波動和不確定性，甚至會發生鐵礦石價格短期回調的可能性。 綜上所述，本集團對二零一二年鐵礦市場的走勢持審慎樂觀的態度。'], ['its gross domestic product gdp growth in the first and second quarters was  and
